You can see a door, a bed, a pressure guage and a light switch here.",
    "zork1": "You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here. ",
    "zork2": "Inside the Barrow You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end. A strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground. A sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.",
    "zork3": "Endless Stair You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail. Your old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet. ",
    "night": "This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...This is the computer site. You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study. An internet router hums quietly in the corner. The door is northeast.",
    "detective": " << Chief\'s office >> You are standing in the Chief\'s office. He is telling you The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. Yessir! You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west. You can see a piece of white paper here.",
    "pentari": "A beautiful day in Bostwin! After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it. When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment. Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center. You can see a postcard here.",
    "weapon": "You pass the sentry watching the doorway to the Yi control room, hardly aware of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the owner of the familiar, frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to a halt behind you. Tolan, the tall, wiry woman says to you. You steel yourself for the need to speak. Cheryl, you reply. Dig Leader Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the galaxy. Again. Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all. You turn your empty hands face-up. Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity. Control Room Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor. Cheryl Thadafel stands here, watching you closely. ",
    "darkhunt": "The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.",
    "loose": "What was that?You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.No, not there! Up here! guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun\'s glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg. Rickety Fence The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn\'t fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn\'t careful... The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north. The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime."
